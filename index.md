# Loan Prediction using ML
Devansh Sharma and Gaurav Kanu

## Motivation 
* Loan is the lending of money by individual in which the borrower incurs a debt that is paid as interest.
* It becomes a  challenging task for banks to find if a person may or may not repay the loan.
* Traditionally bankers take basic information such as annual income ,previous loan history and assets to find out the eligibility of a person.
* With the advancement  of digital banking we now have large datasets containing information about previous loan transactions.
* With the help of machine learning we can build models that can identify the eligibility and amount of loan to be given.

## Plan
* We will make two models, one that classifies if a person is eligible for a loan or not and second is how much loan can be given as a safe investment.
* With the help of Linear regression and Logisitc Regression we can  make both the models.
* We will try to apply Neural Networks on our model to make it much better.

## Algorithms and Datasets

* Algorithms
  * Support Vector Machines
  * Linear Regression
  * Logistic Regression
  * Decision Trees/Random Forests
  * Neural Networks
* Datasets
  * Data from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/altruistdelhite04/loan-prediction-problem-dataset/metadata
  * Data from Lending Club's website

### Division of Labour

* We have planned our tasks till project midway which means completing the Logisitic Regression for loan eligibilty
* Gaurav will work on finding new datasets and see the applicabilty of neural networks on our current model
* Devansh will try to implement Logistic Regression.
* Reports and website will be jointly handled.
